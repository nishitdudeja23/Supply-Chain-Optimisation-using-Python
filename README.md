## Supply Chain Optimization with Python 
Tools: Python, PuLP, Excel

Objective: Optimized plant location and production capacity for a global supply chain to minimize costs and meet demand efficiently.
Techniques Used:
Implemented Linear Programming with the PuLP library to model and solve the supply chain optimization problem.
Analyzed variable and fixed costs, including freight and manufacturing costs, to determine optimal production and location strategies.
Incorporated constraints for demand fulfillment and plant capacity management.
Data Handling:
Utilized Excel for importing and managing variable costs, freight costs, fixed costs, plant capacities, and demand data.
Processed and integrated data to calculate total costs and optimize the supply chain network.
Results:
Successfully minimized total costs while ensuring all demand and capacity constraints were met.
Generated actionable insights and a detailed report on plant capacities and production allocations.
Skills Demonstrated:
Strong analytical and problem-solving skills in a real-world supply chain context.
Proficiency in using Python for optimization and data analysis.
Effective use of linear programming techniques to address complex operational challenges.
